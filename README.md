# Stressinator

Ever want to torture your Mudlet profile and see how it holds up under pressure?

If like me you answered "Ohh, neat!" then I threw this together after reading through the forum topic [Typical Trigger Performace](https://forums.mudlet.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=23089)

## usage

* `stresstest <number of lines to run>`
  * Run the stress test with optional number of times to process the line. Defaults to 10k if no number provided.
* `waitno`
  * Cancels the stresstest if you tried to start one
